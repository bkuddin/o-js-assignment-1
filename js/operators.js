// 1. Declare two variables called "num1" and "num2" and assign them any numeric values.

var sum = num1 + num2;

// 3. Use the subtraction operator to calculate the difference between "num1" and "num2". Store the result in a variable called "difference".

var difference = num1 - num2;

// 4. Use the multiplication operator to calculate the product of "num1" and "num2". Store the result in a variable called "product".

var product = num1 * num2;

// 5. Use the division operator to calculate the quotient of "num1" divided by "num2". Store the result in a variable called "quotient".

var quotient = num1/num2;

// 6. Use the modulus operator to calculate the remainder when "num1" is divided by "num2". Store the result in a variable called "remainder".

var remainder = num1 % num2
